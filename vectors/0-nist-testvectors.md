# NIST Test Vectors

NIST provides testvectors through (at least) two different processes. "[Crypto Toolkit](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/)" test vectors are generally those published during publicatin of a standard. [CAVP](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/) (Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program) test vectors are generated for the use of labs that check FIPS-compliance.

This repo contains both, in the same place.

> "Crypto Toolkit" --> "Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines"
> https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines
> Users of the former "Crypto Toolkit" can now find that content under this project. It includes cryptographic primitives, algorithms and schemes are described in some of NIST's Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), Special Publications (SPs) and NIST Internal/Interagency Reports (NISTIRs).

> "Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program" (CAVP)
> https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program
> The NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) provides validation testing of Approved (i.e., FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended) cryptographic algorithms and their individual components. Cryptographic algorithm validation is a prerequisite of cryptographic module validation.


> "Cryptographic Module Validation Program" (CMVP)
> https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program
> The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) is a joint effort between the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the Department of Commerce and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, a branch of the Communications Security Establishment. The goal of the CMVP is to promote the use of validated cryptographic modules and provide Federal agencies with a security metric to use in procuring equipment containing validated cryptographic modules.
